## Lab Demonstration Projects

Basic Training:
- [Handeye Calibration](./deepclaw/modules/calibration/): Handeye calibration code including 2D and 3D handeye calibration.
- [Data Collection & Labeling](./deepclaw/utils/ImageDataCollection.py): Collect training data of waste sorting.

Sample Projects:
- [2D Picking](./projects/2d_picking): Sample project of 2D picking 
- [6D Picking](./projects/6d_picking): Sample project of 6D picking 

Projects related to reinforcement learning:
- [MadMario](./MadMario): PyTorch tutorial to build an AI-powered Mario. This example is to learn the Double Q-learning (DDQN) algorithm in reinforcement learning.
- [Muzero](./Muzero): The example is to learn the state of the art RL algorithm for board games (Chess, Go, ...) and Atari games. Optional for students who are interested.
- [RL-TaxiV3_Tabular_Q_learning.ipynb](RL-TaxiV3_Tabular_Q_learning.ipynb): train a tabular Q-learning agent on the smart taxi task.
- [RL-CartPole_DQN.ipynb](RL-CartPole_DQN.ipynb): train a Deep Q Learning (DQN) agent on the CartPole-v0 task.
- [RL-CartPole_A2C_online.ipynb](RL-CartPole_A2C_online.ipynb): train a Advance Actor Critic (A2C) agent on the CartPole-v0 task.
- [DoorGym](./DoorGym)
