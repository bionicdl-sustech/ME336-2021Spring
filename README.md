## Lab Demonstration Projects

Projects related to deep learning:
- [HandeyeCalibration](./HandeyeCalibration): Handeye calibration code
- [3DPicking](./3DPicking): Example project of 3D picking 
- [6DPicking](./6DPicking): Example project of 6D picking 

Projects related to reinforcement learning:
