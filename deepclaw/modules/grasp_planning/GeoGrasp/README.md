# GeoGrasp
Geometry-based method for computing grasping points on 3D point clouds. Find more details at: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331358070_Fast_Geometry-based_Computation_of_Grasping_Points_on_Three-dimensional_Point_Clouds

The original github address is https://github.com/yayaneath/GeoGrasp. We modified it to PCL 1.8, and support python call method.

# Requirements
The package has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04. GeoGrasp is wrapped in a python package with the following dependecies:

- pybind11
- PCL 1.8
- vtk 7.1

# usage
Set your python version in CMakelists.txt, and make a build folder for compiling.

> $ mkdir build   
> $ cd build   
> $ cmake ..   
> $ make   
> $ cp ./*.so ../


# Notes

- We have some problems when using pybind11 with apt installed pcl, as it's default vtk version is 6.3. 
Please install the the vtk 7.1 and pcl1.8 from source.

- There are some confliction between PCL, pybind11, and python package open3d. Do not use them in same time.
